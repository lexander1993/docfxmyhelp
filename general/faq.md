# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why fork Emby? Why did you start this project?

We explain our rationale on our [about page](xref:about).

## Why don't you support my favorite client or feature?

Chances are, we'd like to support it! But it hasn't been implemented yet.
Jellyfin is an entirely volunteer-driven project, so until a developer is able and willing to implement a feature, it likely won't be done.
We track our features on [our Fider instance](https://features.jellyfin.org), so please check that out, upvote the features you like, and add your own requests.
If you're a developer and are interested in helping out, [please hack away](xref:contrib-index) and let us know [on Matrix](xref:getting-help) so we can help.

## When will release {X} happen? When will feature {X} be available?

When the Jellyfin team feels it is ready.
Please remember we are all volunteers and want to deliver the best possible experience.
To that end, releases happen when we feel there has been sufficient testing without new issues being found.
Releases are also subject to the availability of the people who manage the builds and publishes for different platforms.

## I'm having problems with Jellyfin, how do I get help?

Please see our [getting help](xref:getting-help) page for details on where to engage the community.

## Why is my media not showing up in Jellyfin?

This normally comes down to one of the following issues:

1. [File permissions](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions) are not properly configured on your media.
2. Your media does not follow the organizational requirements for Jellyfin's scanner to properly identify media. (Valid organization schemes can be found in the documentation for [Movies](xref:server-media-movies), [Shows](xref:server-media-shows), [Music](xref:server-media-music), and others.)

## How can I contribute to this project?

Please see our [contributing guide](xref:contrib-index) page for details on how to get started.
We are always looking for C# and frontend developers, mobile app developers, translators, and documentation writers to help!

## How do I request a new feature?

Please see our [requesting features](xref:contrib-issues#requesting-features) page for details in requesting a new feature in Jellyfin.

## How do I support this project?

All we can ask is you [use Jellyfin](xref:admin-installing), [report any bugs](xref:contrib-issues#reporting-bugs), and tell your friends about us!
Really, we're just people volunteering our time to help build a better media system, so joining the community is the best way to show your support.
We do offer a donations page [on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/jellyfin), however please note that these funds are **only** used for infrastructure. All our developers are unpaid volunteers on principle.
